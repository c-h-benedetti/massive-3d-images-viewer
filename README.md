## Problem:
In medical imaging, the most common way to visualize CT-scans or MRIs is the MPR projection.
It consist in watching the grid of voxel slice by slice on three different axis.

![Y Axis](/imgs-rapport/2-layer111-y.png)
![Z Axis](/imgs-rapport/3-layer606-z.png)

With this projection, it's very hard to imagine the actual size of things and how they are placed.

## This project:
In this project, we propose a solution based on the algorithm of ray-marching, that provides a more explicit result of what's represented in the voxels grid.
